<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web refers to a space where users connected to the Internet can share information with each other.
    It is also called WWW or W3 for short, and is most often called simply Web.   
    Although it is often used interchangeably with the Internet, to be exact, the web is just one popular service on the Internet.
    However, these days, it occupies the largest part of the Internet to the extent that the words Internet and Web are used interchangeably. </p>
